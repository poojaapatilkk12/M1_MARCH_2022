-   The software can be accessed by students, teachers, admin and parents with a role-based login. It collects all the student data along with their personal information which can be easily searched and retrieved later on. The software stores years of data online on a cloud platform.
## Objective of the system

-   The main objective of the student record management system is to provide a tool to efficiently record all data necessary, and also sort it.
-   The people using it only have to choose what they have to do, and enter the data,everything else is taken care of by the program.

## Features proposed in the current system

- Easy Report Generation
- The software helps to generate reports easily in required formats Data Search and Retrieval
- The system can help users to find and retrieve studentâ€™s data over a few clicks High Data Storage
- The system stores large amounts of data without hampering its functioning Role-Based Access

## SWOT ANALYSIS

**STRENGTHS** 
- The system can provide data in sufficient time and in appropriate structure according to management requirements.
- It is suitable for preparing immediate reports from source systems with daily data loading.

**WEAKNESSES**
- Data purity of source systems is dubious; the number of administrators of source systems is particularly high.
- Support of the system depends to a large extent on the vocation of the management.

**OPPORTUNITIES **
- Scalable source systems enable the creation of complex queries building on several source systems.
- Interconnection of information from different processes and topics is provided due to integrated operation, it can support management decisions by creating   multidimensional data models.

**THREATS**
- Public sector leaders are still less motivated in daily usage of MIS.
- Data loading from source systems are done manually and infrequently in certain cases and it has a negative impact on the availability of MIS reports.
